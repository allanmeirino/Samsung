## Getting and Cleaning Data AllanÂ´s Project

This repository contains the script and files related to the final project for the course "Getting and Cleaning Data", whose purpose is to create, from a set of data related to motion sensors of Samsung Galaxy S handsets, a summary descriptive table of the data processed in the form of a tidy data table.
The way in which such data were obtained, processed and summarized is described through the "Codebook.MD" file of this repository. In the same file it is also possible to verify the processes applied in each stage of the project, as well as the meaning of the variables and observations that compose the tidy data table.
The file "run_analysis.R" contains the script itself, while the file "tidy_data.txt" represents the tidy data table generated at the end of processing.
